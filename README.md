# Sample report

Note: The README page is the only page you can interact, so you may want to include all resources/links on this page :)

Go to Settings -> GitHub Pages -> Source: Master branch to deploy your GitHub page. 
If there's no index.html file in the main folder (which should be the case), the content of **this** README would be in your page.
