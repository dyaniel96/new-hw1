⋅⋅* How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?

⋅⋅* How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?

⋅⋅* What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?

⋅⋅* Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.

### Getting A

⋅⋅* Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator

⋅⋅* Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?

⋅⋅* Design and implement interactive features
